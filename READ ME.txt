The only file that is needed for compialing prpject 2 is the memsim.cpp file

How to compile: 
	you run g++ -o memsim memsim.cpp to compile the file or you can 	run make

Running the code:
	If it is a fifo or lru then you need to send this through
		./memsim tracefile Nframes algorithm debug/quiet
	If it is a sfifo then you need to send this through
		./memsim tracefile Nframes algorithm percentage debug/quiet

	
Meanings:
	tracefile- the file that holds the address that need to be looked through 
	Nframes- the amount of frames that the simulation will use/have
	algorithm- this is the method that the simulation will run with(fifo,lru,of vms)
	percentage- this is the amount of the total frames that will be used as the secondary array in segmented fifo(1-100)
	debig/quiet- this is whether or not you want to see what is happening with every address that is getting sent through(debug or quiet)
